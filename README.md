# SAS Agentic AI Accelerator

The SAS Agentic AI Accelerator provides a method for building AI agents leveraging SAS Viya technology.
It is designed to help users move more quickly from use-case idea to production, utilizing *No/Low/Yes* Code interfaces and full governance as a way to build agents that balance autonomy and trust.

It includes:

- The full code + documentation to deploy this in your SAS Viya Environment
- All the integrations that are built (SAS Studio Custom Steps, a no code prompt engineering UI, SAS Intelligent Decisioning Node, SAS Macros, Postman Collection and so much more)
- Pre-build deployment recipes for LLMs
- Pre-build deployment recipes for embedding models

The accelerator builds only on SAS Viya standard components and does not use any unsupported APIs or otherwise undocumented features.
