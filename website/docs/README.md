# SAS Agentic AI Accelerator

The SAS Agentic AI Accelerator provides a method for building AI agents leveraging SAS Viya technology.
It is designed to help users move more quickly from use-case idea to production, utilizing *No/Low/Yes* Code interfaces and full governance as a way to build agents that balance autonomy and trust.

It includes:

- The full code + documentation to deploy this in your SAS Viya Environment
- All the integrations that are built (SAS Studio Custom Steps, a no code prompt engineering UI, SAS Intelligent Decisioning Node, SAS Macros, Postman Collection and so much more)
- Pre-build deployment recipes for LLMs
- Pre-build deployment recipes for embedding models

The accelerator builds only on SAS Viya standard components and does not use any unsupported APIs or otherwise undocumented features.

## Documentation Overview

This documentation has been split into two main sections that you can navigate to using the left hand sidebar:
1. Administration Guide, provides you with instruction on how to set everything up and deploy the different components.
2. User Guide, provides an introduction into all the different integrations and workflows that the SAS Agentic AI Accelerator provides.
