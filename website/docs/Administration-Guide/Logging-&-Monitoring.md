# Logging

The logs from the LLM containers is standardized across all of the different models.
This has been done in order to be able to parse all of the relevant information from the logs and create monitoring on top of them.

In order to make use of these logs, which are written to the standard out of each container, you must collect the logs.
If you do not have an established logging and monitoring process, you can use the simplified logging script provided below.
Otherwise, if you do have an established way of collecting logs, ensure that you can export them to a folder that can be accessed from SAS Studio as a `.log` file (as that it is the input for the parsing utilities).

For more information on how to parse the log and load it into to SAS please take a look at `SAS-Viya-Integrations/Logging-Monitoring`.

## Simplified Logging via a Script

Only use this script if you do not have a more robust process in place.

Create a script—for example `collect_llm_logs.sh`—and ensure that it is executable.
Use the code below and change both the namespace and the log path.
The namespace should be the namespace into which you have deployed the models, and the path needs to be reachable from inside of SAS Studio.
You can also change the logging interval; note that any changes you make here will have to be reflected in the entry for the `crontab`.
The default here also replaces the log file as the assumption is that you pick up the new entries using the parsing script and append (though a full replacement is also supported).

```bash
# Set the script variables for your environment
llm_namspace="llm"
llm_log_path="/viya-share/pvs/sasdata/data/llm/llms.log"
llm_logging_interval="1h"
# Remove the next line to append to the log file isntead
rm $llm_log_path
for pod in $(kubectl get pods -n $llm_namspace -o name); do
  kubectl logs -n $llm_namspace $pod --all-containers --since=$llm_logging_interval >> $llm_log_path
done
```

Next add the following entry to your crontab (`crontab -e`), adjusting your path to the script:

```bash
0 * * * * /viya-share/pvs/sasdata/data/llm/collect_llm_logs.sh
```

This entry will run the log collection script at the top of every hour.

# The LLM Usage Report

The repository ships a ready-made SAS Visual Analytics report,
[`SAS-Viya-Integrations/Logging-Monitoring/LLM Usage Report.json`](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-agentic-ai-accelerator/blob/main/SAS-Viya-Integrations/Logging-Monitoring/LLM%20Usage%20Report.json),
as a transfer package. It is the **recommended template** for monitoring LLM
usage and prompt experimentation in your environment — import it and use it as-is,
or as the starting point for your own dashboards.

## Prerequisites — the tables it reads

The report builds on four CAS tables, **all expected in the `Public` caslib by
default**. Load them (promoted and saved) before or after importing so the report
has data to bind to:

| Table | Produced by |
|---|---|
| `LLM_LOGS` | Parsing the collected container logs — `Log-Parser-Code.sas` or the *LLM - Log Parser* SAS Studio custom step |
| `LLM_FACT_SHEET` / `EMBEDDING_FACT_SHEET` | `mdb load-facts` (or `Load-Fact-Sheets.sas`) — see [Model Definition Builder](./Model-Definition-Builder.md) |
| `PROMPT_EXPERIMENTS` | `Get-All-Prompts.sas` (the LLM Prompt Builder experiment tracker) |

## Import the report

Import the transfer package exactly as for the Prompt Builder package — through
the **SAS Environment Manager → Content → Import** page, or with the `sas-viya`
CLI `transfer` plugin:

```bash
sas-viya transfer packages upload --file "LLM Usage Report.json"   # prints the package id
sas-viya transfer packages import --id <package-id>
```

(On older `transfer` plugin versions the same commands are `sas-viya transfer
upload` / `sas-viya transfer import` — they still work, marked deprecated.)

The CLI must be installed with the `transfer` plugin and a signed-in profile —
see [Introduction — SAS Viya CLI Setup](./Introduction.md#sas-viya-cli-setup).
After import the report appears under **SAS Content > SAS Agentic AI Accelerator >
Logging and Monitoring > LLM Usage Report**.

## Change the CAS library (default: `Public`)

The report binds each of its four tables to
`server=cas-shared-default;library=Public`. If your tables live in a **different
CAS library**, repoint them one of two ways:

- **SAS Viya CLI** — before uploading, replace the library in the package (every
  binding uses the same `library=Public` token, so a single substitution is safe),
  then upload/import as above:

  ```bash
  # bash / Linux / macOS
  sed -i 's/library=Public/library=MyLib/g' "LLM Usage Report.json"
  ```

  ```powershell
  # PowerShell / Windows
  (Get-Content "LLM Usage Report.json") -replace 'library=Public','library=MyLib' |
    Set-Content "LLM Usage Report.json"
  ```

  (If your CAS server is not `cas-shared-default`, substitute
  `server=cas-shared-default` the same way.)

- **SAS Environment Manager / SAS Visual Analytics** — import the package as-is,
  then open **LLM Usage Report** in SAS Visual Analytics and, in the **Data** pane,
  use **Edit → Change data source** on each of the four tables to point to the same
  table in your library.

:::note
The imported report keeps its identifier `/reports/reports/1f08db8d-d6c6-4ed1-9684-e7d11c4ec50c` —
the same URI shown as the example `SAS_LLM_MODEL_CARD_REPORT_URI` and the Prompt
Builder *Model card report URI* — so once imported it can double as the model-card
custom chart for your registered models and manifested prompts.
