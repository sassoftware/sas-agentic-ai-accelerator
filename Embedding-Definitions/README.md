# Embedding Definitions

This folder contains information on how to add Embedding models to the repository in the SAS Model Manager. Each model is packaged so that it can be deployed using the SAS Container Runtime (SCR).

More on the SCR in the [SAS Documentation](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/mascrtcdc/default/mascrtag/titlepage.htm).

Each subfolder here contains the definition for one specific Embedding model - the name of the folder specifies the embedding model.
